HCI PROJECT
Most of us have become lethargic by sitting at home in the lockdown due to this pandemic situation. The
absence of street food has made many people rely on packed snacks which have harmful preservatives and
has taken a toll on overall health and fitness of public. With this interactive website we aim to solve the
crave of people of all kinds. From one’s wanting to taste fast foods to the one’s who are willing to get in
shape eating a completely healthy diet . What feature stands out in our project would be the user interaction,
the feature specialises in taking recipes from user which would make our proposed application much more
interactive than most of the applications already present out there. With this we would like to increase the
tradition of recipe sharing so that none of the recipes go unseen.
We plan to create a website for the user and by the user.

Modules

HOME PAGE
The homepage has a list of most common ingredients from which the user can select a few.
Then a list of possible recipes is shown which can be made from the specified ingredients which are
already posted on the site.
This feature is well suited for most of the users as they can put the extra vegetables and food items lying at
home to their best use, hence reducing the wastage.

This simple yet important feature is best suited for amateur chefs who are curious and want to select the
best recipe that they can experiment with.

“user – friendly “ and “interactive” in real sense.
This feature gives an opportunity to everyone who aspires to gain recognition for his or her cooking skills
but has not been able to do so yet for various reasons, in the easiest possible way
